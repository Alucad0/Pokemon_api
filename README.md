### Descrption of the project

This project is going to be a fully automated pokemon guessing game. The program will start by asking the user if they wanna play (input = str yes or no). If the answer is yes, that they wanna play, then the first round will begin with round (round = 1).The user is going to be guessing "who is that pokemon?" (while they wanna play) and successively get more and more clues with each incorect guess until there are no more clues to be given (counting up with each loop and clues will be given depending on the counter). Thereupon, after all the clues have been shown, the user will have 2 remaining guesses (if count = x then game over). After the user has either guess wrong or incorrectly too many times the round will end and it will ask the user wether they wanna continue playing or quit (input = quit or play). If the user decides to continue playing then the round counter will increase (round += 1). 

### Requirements

- Python.
- request module.
- random module.

### Installation

Pokemon_api is was made with __Python 3.7+__. You can download the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The two packages (random & requests) can be install your IDE (Intergrated Developer Enviroment). Note that each IDE has a different way to install packages. Otherwise you can use the your command prompt and changing the directory to where Python is installd and into the scripts folder. There type `pip install requests` and `pip install random`

### Issuetracker

- Everything so far.
- Programming is hard.

### Code conventions

**File organisation:** The code is divided into different files, by order of functions, for easier interaction and to facilitate contributions.

**Naming convention:** All the files use **snake_case** for variable names.

**Comments:** One-line comments are written above the code line to explain the code and its purpose. The same principle applies to block comments.

### API

dokumentationen för vad alla funktioner göra, ifall de returnerar något vad är det som de returenar.
