### Descrption of the project

This project is going to be a fully automated pokemon guessing game. 
The user is going to be guessing "who is that pokemon?" and get succesivly more and more clues with each incorect guess until there are no more clues to be given. 

### Requirements

You are going to need to use the random and requests modules.

### Installation

Pokemon_api is was med with __Python 3.7+__. You can download the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The two modules (random & requests) can you install by opening your command prompt and changing the directory to where Python is installd and into the scripts folder. There use the 'pip' to install the required module (pip install “module name”)

### Issuetracker

- Everything so far.
- Programming is hard.

### Code conventions

The code is divided into differernt files for eaiser understandability. All the files uses __snake_case__. The end-of-line comments are to describe the lines of code that are followed by the comments. The same principle applies to the block comments.

### API

dokumentationen för vad alla funktioner göra, ifall de returnerar något vad är det som de returenar.
