first create an ez version:

Clues order:
amount of letters + ability + generation, typing, index + first letter, dark siluette of the sprite, sprite from trainer POV in colour
if the guess is incorrect after the coloured sprite then they lose. 



things to add later:

it will just be a terminal game - with rounds
    start menu with options (quit or play while showing highscore)
        after getting a score it will ask for the name of the player to enter into the highscore list
the sprites can be opened in the browser 

might add a highscore system for the menu


harder version:

things to do:
create a pop up window

order of the clues:
amount of letters, generation, ability, typing, index, first letter, dark siluette sprite (gif - if possible)
    
    
bad drawing of how the popup window will look:
